**Prepared by:** Library Innovators  
**Date:** December 7, 2024  

---

### **Executive Summary**  
This report evaluates the library's operational metrics, focusing on loan processing, overdue books, fine collections, and borrowing trends. Key findings include:  
- Some resource types exhibit significantly longer borrowing durations.  
- Overdue rates are most prevalent during peak borrowing periods.  
- Fine collections follow a predictable monthly pattern.  
- Borrowing peaks occur during weekends and specific hours.  

These insights inform strategies for improving operational efficiency and member satisfaction.  

##### Please find five screenshots relevant to the SQL Queries in this report within the same repository as this report.

### **1. Average Borrowing Time**  

#### **Description**  
Identifies the average borrowing duration for resources.  

#### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    resourceID,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(returnDate, borrowDate)) AS avgBorrowingTime
FROM Borrowing
WHERE returnDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY resourceID
ORDER BY avgBorrowingTime DESC;
```  

#### **Insights**  
Refer to `average_borrowing_time.png` in the repository:  
- Resource `4033` has an average borrowing time of **348 days**, indicating a highly engaged or limited availability resource.  
- Other resources with significantly high borrowing times include `4695`, `4696`, and `5198`, all averaging **45 days**.

### **2. Overdue Book Rates**  

#### **Description**  
Calculates the percentage of overdue books over the year.  

#### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS totalBorrowed,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(returnDate, dueDate) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS overdueBooks,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(returnDate, dueDate) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS overdueRate
FROM Borrowing
WHERE borrowDate BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```  

#### **Insights**  
Refer to `overdue_book_rates.png` in the repository:  
- Out of **5,553 borrowed items**, **2,077** were overdue, resulting in an overdue rate of **37.40%**, highlighting the need for interventions like automated reminders.  

---

### **3. Fine Collection Trends**  

#### **Description**  
Analyzes monthly fine collection patterns.  

#### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(borrowDate) AS fineMonth,
    SUM(lateFee) AS totalFines
FROM Borrowing
WHERE lateFee IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY fineMonth
ORDER BY fineMonth;
```  

#### **Insights**  
Refer to `fine_collection_trends.png` in the repository:  
- Monthly fines vary significantly, with the highest collections in January and the lowest in June.  

---

### **4. Peak Borrowing Periods**  

#### **Description**  
Examines borrowing patterns by weekday and hour to identify peak periods.  

#### **SQL Queries**  
**By Weekday:**  
```sql
SELECT 
    DAYOFWEEK(borrowDate) AS weekday,
    COUNT(*) AS totalCheckouts
FROM Borrowing
GROUP BY weekday
ORDER BY totalCheckouts DESC;
```  

**By Hour:**  
```sql
SELECT 
    HOUR(borrowDate) AS borrowHour,
    COUNT(*) AS totalCheckouts
FROM Borrowing
GROUP BY borrowHour
ORDER BY totalCheckouts DESC;
```  

#### **Insights**  
Refer to `peak_borrowing_periods.png` in the repository:  
- The busiest borrowing day is **Sunday (weekday 1)**, with **899 total checkouts**, followed by **Saturday (weekday 7)** with **878 checkouts**.  
- Borrowing peaks during **midnight (borrowHour 0)** with **6,003 total checkouts**, indicating a preference for late-night borrowing.  

---

### **5. Bottleneck Analysis**  

#### **Description**  
Identifies resources with the longest borrowing durations to highlight potential bottlenecks.  

#### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    resourceID,
    COUNT(*) AS timesBorrowed,
    MAX(DATEDIFF(returnDate, borrowDate)) AS maxBorrowingTime
FROM Borrowing
WHERE returnDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY resourceID
ORDER BY maxBorrowingTime DESC;
```  

#### **Insights**  
Refer to `bottleneck_analysis.png` in the repository:  
- Resource `4033` had the longest borrowing duration, spanning **6519 days**.  

---

### **Recommendations**  

1. **Optimize Loan Periods:** Adjust loan durations for frequently overdue or highly demanded resources.  
2. **Automate Reminders:** Implement return reminders to reduce overdue rates.  
3. **Adjust Staffing:** Increase staffing during peak borrowing periods.  
4. **Fine Policy Adjustments:** Introduce fine forgiveness campaigns to encourage timely returns.  

By implementing these measures, the library can enhance its efficiency and service quality while fostering member engagement.
