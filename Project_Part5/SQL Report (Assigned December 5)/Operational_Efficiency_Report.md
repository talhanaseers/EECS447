1. Book Loan and Return Processing Times
Description

This section examines the average time taken for loans to be returned, helping identify inefficiencies in processing times.

SQL Query

2. Overdue Book Rates
Description

Overdue rates help assess member borrowing behavior and resource availability issues.

SQL Query

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_borrowed,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(return_date, due_date) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS overdue_books,
    (SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(return_date, due_date) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS overdue_rate
FROM borrowing
WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL;

3. Fine Collection Trends
Description

This section analyzes patterns in fine payments to optimize collection strategies.

SQL Query

FROM borrowing
WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY resource_id
ORDER BY max_borrowing_time DESC;
