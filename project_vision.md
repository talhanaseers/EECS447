# Database Project Vision Statement and Plan

## Tasks

### 1. Vision Statement
The goal of the Library Management System is to streamline the management of library resources, memberships, and borrowing activities through a reliable, user-friendly platform. By integrating automated processes, the system will enhance the efficiency of library staff and improve the borrowing experience for clients.

### 2. Scope Statement
This project will involve the design, development, and deployment of a relational database system to manage a library's inventory of books, digital media, and magazines, along with client memberships and borrowing rules. It will include functionalities for tracking item availability, enforcing borrowing limits, calculating late fees, and generating detailed reports, with a focus on multi-user support, transaction management, and role-based access control.
